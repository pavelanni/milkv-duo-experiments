This is a collection of my experiments with the Milk-V Duo board.
It is based on RISC-V CPU and it runs Linux inside.
So it's not similar to Arduino or Raspberry Pi Pico where the board runs only your program that you flashed on it.
With Milk-V Duo you have an actual Linux with several dozen of processes running, and all the usual commands, including `vi`.

Out of the box it supports RNDIS networking (Ethernet over USB) so when I connected it to a USB cable connected to my Fedora Linux laptop I could `ssh` into it.
I'm going to add an RJ-45 connector to it or a breakout board to use normal Ethernet.

I'm planning to use Go on this board so I made a couple of changes in the kernel configuration and rebuilt the image (see in the `build-container` directory).

`hello` is just a Hello, World program in Go compiled for this board (of course!).

`http` is a simple HTTP server running on this board (a dozen lines in Go).

`montecarlo` is a program calculating Pi using the Monte-Carlo method.
I copied it from here: https://ggcarvalho.dev/posts/montecarlo/ and it seems to be a simple way to quickly measure CPU performance.

Also I collected some information about GPIO numbers (because I spent some time figuring it out myself so maybe it will save time for somebody else).
Find the _GPIO pins and numbers_ document in the `docs` directory.

== Using `gpiod`

I started using the `gpiod` Go library written by @warthog618: https://github.com/warthog618/gpiod.
Duo has a different pin naming scheme so I had to create my own mapping function.

In this board there are 5 GPIO chips (`gpiochip0` to `gpiochip4`).
The pins are named like `GPIOA14`, `GPIOC9`, or `PWR_GPIO21` and they are served by different chips.
In this case the names above would be translated to `gpiochip0` + offset 14, `gpiochip2` + offset 9,
and `gpiochip4` + offset 21 respectively.

The mapping function is located here: https://github.com/pavelanni/gpiod-milkvduo.
You'll find more details and a simple example there.
